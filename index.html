      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>My condolences to you for having wandered aimlessly onto this 
        page and for having gained the unfortunate obligation to read the 
        content on said page. My name is Christine and I've been an ESL 
        teacher for the last five years, three of which were spent in Japan. 
        I spend more time in museums, laundromats, and libraries than any club, 
        absent the pretentious attitude. Breakfast food, in all its delectable 
        glory, is to be eaten at any time of day, particularly at 3am, a fact I 
        could have probably started and ended with and this introduction would be 
        complete. But frivolity! Why not.  </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm originally from a small town, Kincardine, on Lake Huron where 
        the opinions are far from progressive and the mindsets are chronically
         homogenous! But at least there's a beach overcrowded with pompous tourists 
         for two months each year, so it's not all bad. Please disregard my eye roll.
      </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Though I lack skill in just about every single one of them, I'm a big fan of 
        reading, painting, pen drawing, playing (badly) 90's RPGs, and cooking.
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Were money and time no object, I'd be a Professor of Art History with a 
        concentration in Medieval Manuscripts and self representation in commissioned 
        works. BUT. Somehow sinking another $100,000 into education without any job 
        prospects seems like a lesson failed to be learned.  

      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>After a six month stint living in my friend's kitchen, I've moved into to my 
        own tiny 357 square feet here in Toronto.
      </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I love opportunities to learn and given my background with language and analysis,
        web development seemed like a good fit as it offers avenues to be creative, 
        detail-oriented, and gain new knowledge in the field.
